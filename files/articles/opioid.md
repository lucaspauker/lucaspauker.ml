#The Opioid Crisis: Who is at Fault?

##Introduction
According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/index.html), deaths from opioid overdose have increased by a factor of 6 since 1999.
In 2017, almost 50,000 people died from opioid overdoses.
Allegations that Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, fueled the crisis has dominated the recent news.
In 2007, Purdue payed $600 million to settle charges that they mislead the public about the addictive potential of Oxycontin.
This raises the question: can we blame Purdue for the opioid crisis?
Who else shares the blame?
We will first explore the relationship between prescription drugs and opiate addiction, then look at the role of Purdue and the FDA in the crisis.

##Prescription and Addiction
In order to understand the effect of different institutions, we must understand how prescribing opioids relates to addiction and how prescription users transition to using illegal opioids such as heroin.
